# Tally Tool

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Custom react scripts through [react-browser-extension-scripts](https://github.com/VasilyShelkov/create-react-extension#readme)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Turn on Chrome Extension developer mode, load unpacked, and select the dev folder generated by npm start. Refresh the webpage and extension to see updates.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This folder can be loaded into Chrome as well.
